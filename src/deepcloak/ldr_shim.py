"""Install the Stealth Fetch into local-deep-research (ADR-0001).

We override the narrowest seam — ``AutoHTMLDownloader._fetch_html``, the method
that returns a page's raw HTML — so every HTML fetch in LDR's pipeline runs
through ``fetch_router`` (plain → Escalate → Stealth Fetch) and records an
Evidence Record. LDR's own text extraction (justext) still runs on the HTML we
return, so we reuse it rather than reimplementing it.

The seam is an internal LDR symbol, so the LDR version is pinned (==) and the
seam must be re-verified on upgrade.
